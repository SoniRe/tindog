## Introduction

Tindog is a playful and entertaining website that brings dog lovers together. It provides a platform where users can create profiles for their furry friends and connect with other dog owners in their area. Tindog aims to foster friendships and potentially help dogs find their soulmates!

This repository serves as the central hub for the Tindog website's source code and assets. If you are interested in contributing or exploring the codebase, this is the place to start.

## Getting Started

To get started with Tindog, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/SoniRe/tindog.git`.
2. Ensure you have a compatible web development environment set up. You will need a text editor, a web browser, and a local server if you prefer to run the website locally.
3. Open the project files in your preferred text editor.
4. If you plan to run the website locally, start a local server and navigate to the project folder in your web browser. Alternatively, you can also deploy the website to a hosting service of your choice.
5. Explore the source code and assets to understand the project structure and how the different components work together.
6. Feel free to make changes, experiment, and customize the website to your liking.

## Usage

Tindog is a website meant for browsing, connecting with other dog owners, and enjoying the fun elements of a dating app for dogs. You can create a profile for your dog, browse through other dog profiles, and swipe right or left to show interest or disinterest. If both parties show interest, you can initiate a conversation through the messaging functionality.

Please note that since Tindog is a mock-up project, the website's functionality is limited, and no real interactions or data persistence occur.
